# Amazon Vine Analysis 
## Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. More specifically, if having a paid Vine review made a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.  

Amazon reviews of musical instruments sold in the United States was selected for this project. A Google Colab notebook with PySpark was used to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an Amazon Web Service (AWS) relational database server (RDS) instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin.  Structured query language (SQL) was used to determine if there was any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. 
The following DataFrames were created, these were transformed into tables in pgAdmin as per the challenge deliverable requirements:
- a. customers_table
- b. products_table
- c. review_id_table
- d. vine_table
Screen shots of the tables are in Appendix I. below.

The following steps were then taken to create the additional tables needed for the analysis.
- a. vine_table was queried to select rows where the total vote count was greater than or equal to 20 to pick reviews that would likely be more helpful and to avoid having division by zero errors with future queries. The results were saved in vine_table2.
- b. vine_table2 was queried to retrieve all rows where the number of helpful_votes divided by total_votes was greater than or equal to 50%. The results were saved in vine_table3. Steps a. and b. were done to normalize the data.
- c. vine_table3 was queried to retrieve all rows where a review was written as part of the Vine program (paid). The results were saved in vine_table4.
- d. vine_table 3 was then queried to retrieve all rows where a review was not part of the Vine program (unpaid). The results were saved in vine_table5.

Finally, vine_table 3 was queried to return:
  - e. The total number of reviews
  - f. The total number of 5-star reviews
  - g. The percentage of 5-star reviews for non-paid and paid reviews relative to the total number of reviews    
  - h. The percentage of all reviews that were non-paid and paid was also retrieved for comparison.

Screen shots of the pgAdmin tables are located in Appendix II. below.

## Results
The findings are listed below.

| A. Total | B. Non-Paid | C. Vine Paid | D. 5-Star | E. 5-Star Non-Paid| F. 5-Star Paid| 
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
|  14,537  |   14,477    |        60    |     8,246 |             8,212 |            34 | 

- A. Total Reviews: 14,537
- B. Total Non-Paid Reviews: 14,477;
  - 99.6% of Total Reviews(A.)
- C. Total Vine Paid Reviews: 60
  - 0.4% of Total Reviews(A.)  
- D. Total 5-Star Reviews: 8,246
- E. Total 5-Star Non-Paid Reviews: 8,212;
  -  56% of the Total Reviews(A.) 
  -  57% of the Non-Paid Reviews(B.) 
- F. Total Vine paid 5-Star reviews: 34; 
  - 0.23% of the total Reviews(A.) 
  - 56% of the Vine Paid Reviews(C.)

## Conclusions
It was noted that 56% of the Vine paid and 57% of the non-paid reivews had a rating of 5-stars, which at a glance would indicate that there wasn't a positivity bias present. However, there were only 60 paid reviews overall, with 34 of these being rated at 5-Stars. Additional ananlysis is recommended with a larger data set to include:
- Verified purchase information
- Customer demographic, voting and rating patterns
- Product details 
- Time line 
- Compensation type and value
